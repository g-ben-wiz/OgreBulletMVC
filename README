Ogre & Bullet thing for my blog

This is a demo I wrote that uses Ogre and Bullet to move a character around with WASD movement. It's meant to be a template for 3D applications that use the MVC pattern and character movement. Nothing too serious.

If you have automake, you should be able to build with the following commands:
autoreconf -i
./configure
make

If not, this code relies on the Ogre and Bullet libraries, and also good luck.
